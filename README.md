# MiniShakespeare
Following the [Transformer lecture](https://youtu.be/kCc8FmEb1nY?si=7PimS39J25nhr2A7) by Andrej Karpathy, I build a decoder transformer from the ground up using PyTorch.</br>
The transformer trains on 1M characters from the completed works of Shakespeare and can produce more Shakespeare-like content.
